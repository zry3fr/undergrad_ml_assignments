The value of `X_train[i]` and `X_test[i]`, however, is a 28$\\times$28 array whose entries contain values between 0 and 256. Each element of the matrix is essentially a \"pixel\" and the matrix encodes a representation of a number. To visualize this, run the following code to see the first ten numbers:\n",

    "3. Use Numpy's `.reshape()` method to covert the training and testing data from a list of matrix into an vector of features. So, `X_test[index].reshape((1,784))` will convert the $index$-th element of `X_test` into a $28\\times 28=784$-length row vector of values, rather than a matrix. Turn `X_train` into an $N \\times 784$ matrix $X$ that is suitable for scikit-learn's kNN classifier where $N$ is the number of observations and $784=28*28$ (you could use, for example, a `for` loop).\n",

    "7. So, this is how computers \"see.\" They convert an image into a matrix of values, that matrix becomes a vector in a dataset, and then we deploy ML tools on it as if it was any other kind of tabular data. To make sure you follow this, invent a way to represent a color photo in matrix form, and then describe how you could convert it into tabular data. (Hint: RGB color codes provide a method of encoding a numeric value that represents a color.)"
